# Note that this rule is disabled by default. It's useful only to
# verify that the cloudtrail plugin is sending events properly.  The
# very broad condition evt.num > 0 only works because the rule source
# is limited to aws_cloudtrail. This ensures that the only events that
# are matched against the rule are from the cloudtrail plugin (or
# a different plugin with the same source).
